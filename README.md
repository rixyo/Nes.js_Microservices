# Nest.js Microservices Mono Repo
This repository contains a set of Nest.js microservices organized within a mono repo structure. The microservices utilize various technologies and features, including RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, authentication guards (AuthGuard), interceptors, decorators, GraphQL, and TypeORM. This README provides an overview of the project's structure and key components.
## Introduction
This project showcases the power of Nest.js as a versatile framework for building microservices. The mono repo structure allows you to manage multiple microservices under a single project, making it easier to maintain and deploy your services. Each microservice may have its own unique functionality and use cases, but they share common infrastructure and libraries.
## Microservices
In this repository, you will find various microservices, each serving a specific purpose. Here's a brief overview of some of the microservices included:

* Microservice 1: Description of the first microservice.
* Microservice 2: Description of the second microservice.
* Microservice 3: Description of the third microservice.

## Technologies
The project leverages the following technologies and Nest.js features:

* RabbitMQ: Message broker for communication between microservices.
* PostgreSQL: Relational database for data storage.
* AuthGuard: Authentication guard for securing routes.
* Interceptor: Interceptors for handling request/response manipulation.
* Decorator: Custom decorators for adding metadata to classes and methods.
* GraphQL: GraphQL API integration for flexible data querying.
* TypeORM: Object-relational mapping for database interactions.
